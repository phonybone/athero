bug fixes:

If you change any of the signatures of a workflow or activities
interface, you also have to change the version number.  Otherwise you
get a "incompatible changes" exception.  

WF methods that use promises need to go in 
@Asynchronous private methods(Promise<whatever>).

Make absolutely sure that hosts are running up-to-date workers (both
workflow and activity).

It's better to specify all the timeouts during registration at the
console.  If you run an unregistered activity (or wf), it'll get the
tasklist used as a default.  This can be bad if it was a host-specific
asklist.  Don't forget NO_DEFAULT_TASK_LIST.
