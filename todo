Need to rework RnaseqPipelineWorkflowImpl; call to call_rnaseq_count
is totally messed, we're probably going to need more arguments in the
workflow constructor, or maybe do some filename manipulation.

Need to read up on @Asynchronous methods in SWF; experiement with the
SleepWorkflow, starting with adding a Promise<> arg to call_sleep2().
There should be a generated method that accepts an arbitrary list of
promises.



figure out how to package mvn-run as a self-contained script (ie,
package all jars together and set classpath) (or run from a web
server) 
see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5107988/how-to-tell-maven-to-build-an-executable-jar

re-examine logging, properties utilities.

refactor ActivitiesHost and WorkflowHost, and maybe WorkflowExecuter
as well.

Implement actual script invokation

Design actual interface; how much in config files, how much in
command-line params?

figure out how to test workflows using junit spinoff
